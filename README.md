Part 1Create a simple linked list program to create a class list containing class node {void *info; node *next; public: }; node (void *v) {info = v; next = O; } void put_next (node *n) {next = n;} node *get_next ( ) {return next;} void *get_info ( ) {return info;} Be able to initially fill the list. Provide functions to insert/append nodes and remove nodes from the linked list. Be able to display the contents of the list. Write a little driver program with at least 5 values passed in (so that 5 nodes are created) as you insert/append, delete and display data, showing the programs operation. Part 2 Create a program that uses a derived class based on the list class youâ€™ve created in the first program. This program will use a stack data type. class node {void *info; node *next; public: }; node (void *v) {info = v; next = O; } void put_next (node *n) {next = n;} node *get_next ( ) {return next;} void *get_info ( ) {return info;} class list {node *head; int node_num; public: list ( ) { node_num = O; head = O;}void remove (int);void insert (void *, int);void append (void * v) {insert (v, node_num + I ); } void *find (int);void display ( );}; Write functions to push and pop the stack. Write a driver main program which gives 5 values (5 nodes created) that will push, pop and display data stored.
